* Cleaned the data and added categories using Python, which allowed for a more in-depth analysis of the data.
* Plotted and discovered key information using Tableau, which enabled the visualization of the data and helped identify patterns and trends.
* Designed an interactive dashboard of my expenses using Tableau, which presented the data in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.
* **Coding Languages:** Excel, Python, Tableau


## Rough analysis with Excel
* Using the "Spendings" column, I made a "Debits" and "Credits" column
* Formed a pivot table to analyze monthly spendings
* Created a monthly expenses bar chart using the "Debits" column
* Excel file name: "my_spendings_feb2021_feb2022.xlsx"

## Data Manipulation with Python
* Imported the above excel data into Python with Pandas
* Filtered unnecessary columns and data values
* Split data values into expense categories (Food, Items, Activities, Utilities, Stocks, and Transfers)
* Outputted csv file: "updated_spendings202102_202202.csv"
* Pivotted monthly expenses to add a Tableau widget
* Outputted csv file: "month_spendings202102_202202.csv"
* Python file name: "Spending Analysis (Feb2021_Feb2022).ipynb"

## Tableau Dashboard
* Gathered key numerical data points
* Plotted pie chart of the expense categories distribution
* Displayed total monthly expenses in the past year
* Produced an interactive plot of the expense categories per month
* Planned a dashboard with the above information
